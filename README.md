# Mathematical Animations
1. I have coded visualizations of some mathematical properties in Processing (a java animations library), my code is a bit messy but i think it will be readable enough. You can run the code in the Processing Developement Environment (PDE) itself.  
2. It has very basic functionality only . If you find a bug you can open a pull request

# Prerequisities
1. You should have Java installed.
2. You should also download and install the [Processing Developement Environment](https://processing.org/)

# How the program works

1. The program called Ellipse demonstrates the property of an ellipse that the sum of focal distances for a point on the ellipse remains constant (it is equal to twice the length of the major (longer) axis of the ellipse)

2. The program called Hyperbola demonstrates the property of a hyperbola that the absolute value of the difference of focal distances for a point on the hyperbola remains constant (it is equal to twice the length of the transverse (longer) axis of the hyperbola)

3. The third program generates cardioids  

4. Here is a single cardioid, you can change the variables in the program and it will make more in just one image
